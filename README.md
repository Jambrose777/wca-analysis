# WCA analysis repository

This repository hosts my scripts, analyses, etc. related to the [World Cube Association (WCA)](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/).

## Content

* **results-scripts** contains scripts I have written to analyse the WCA database for inconsistencies as part of my work as leader of the WCA Results Team (WRT).
* **statistic-scripts** contains script I have written to generate fun statistics based on WCA results.
* **euro2016-staff-assignment** contains the script that I have written (in rather dirty code...) in July 2016 to automate the staff assignments for the WCA European Championships 2016 (where I was one of the organizers).
