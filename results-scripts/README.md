# WRT scripts

This folder contains scripts I have written to analyse the WCA database for inconsistencies as part of my work as leader of the WCA Results Team (WRT). 

## Content

* **bad_names_analysis**: analysis of person names for wrong character encodings.
* **combined_round_analysis**: analysis of combined rounds for inconsistent numbers of results.
* **record_marker_analysis**: analysis of inconsistencies within the WCA's whole record history.
* **scramble_validity_analysis**: checking the validity of the scrambles stored in the WCA database (using per-event regular expressions)

For more information, please check the docstrings in the Python files.
