# WRT scripts

This folder contains scripts I have written to analyse the WCA database for inconsistencies as part of my work as leader of the WCA Results Team (WRT). 

## Content

* **combined_round_analysis**: analysis of combined rounds for inconsistent numbers of results.
* **record_marker_analysis**: analysis inconsistencies within the WCA's whole record history.

For more information, please check the docstrings in the Python files.
