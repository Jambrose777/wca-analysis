# Euro 2016 staff assignment script

I have written this script in July 2016 to automate the staff assignments for the WCA European Championships 2016 (where I was one of the organizers).

Just a few notes:
* Unfortunately, the script is not very general and very much tailored for Euro2016.
* The script uses 'Grouping.dat', 'schedule.dat' and 'staff.dat' as (hardcoded) input files and produces all the output files present in '/output'.
* In retrospect, the code is written very dirty, but it had to be done rather quickly. I never had the motivation to revise it or add explanatory comments, so I apologize upfront to everyone who is having a look at it. :)
* However, the script worked pretty well and its output was used for the final staff assignments (with some manual adjustments in addition).
